Here's the process

Identify areas for improvement through interviews, workshops and observation
Propose a tailored plan with clear and measurable goals for improvement
Deliver appropriate in-house training to support the goals. Possible areas include:
Modern development processes based on agile and lean principles
Modern application architecture
Software technologies (including JavaScript and NoSQL databases)
Modern development techniques (including test-driven development, pair programming and Git workflows)
Continuous integration and continuous delivery
We will then work with your teams supporting them in applying these new skills and technologies
Reporting on the original goals and, together with the teams, recommending the next steps for further improvements
